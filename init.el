;; Custom User configurations:
;; If you wish to add additional functionality to your emacs config beyond what is in this setup,
;; simply add a file called "user-customizations.el" to your .emacs.d/lisp/ directory. Within that file,
;; you have access to the (require-package ...) function defined here, so for example, you could have:
;; (require-package 'rainbow-delimiters)
;; This would be all that is needed for emacs to automatically download the Rainbow Delimiters package
;; from Melpa. Additional configs of any kind could be added to this user-customizations.el file.
;; If the file is ommitted, no problem, no customizations are run.
